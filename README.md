# Deep-Q-learning-Lunar-Landing
This project demonstrates the use of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) to solve the Lunar Lander problem from OpenAI Gym. The objective is to train an agent to land a lunar module safely between the flags on the lunar surface using reinforcement learning.

Overview
The Lunar Lander environment presents a challenging control problem in which an agent must learn how to control the thrusters of a lunar module to land it safely. The agent receives rewards based on its actions, and the goal is to maximize the cumulative reward over time.

Key Features:
Deep Q-Learning (DQL): Implementation of a DQN agent using a neural network to approximate Q-values.
OpenAI Gym Environment: Utilizes the LunarLander-v2 environment, which provides physics-based dynamics for simulating lunar lander control.
Experience Replay: The agent uses experience replay to store past experiences and learn from them in a stable manner.
Epsilon-Greedy Policy: The agent balances exploration and exploitation by following an epsilon-greedy strategy.

How It Works
Deep Q-Learning (DQL)
DQL is a reinforcement learning technique where a neural network is used to approximate the Q-values for each state-action pair. The algorithm aims to learn an optimal policy by updating Q-values based on the reward received after taking an action.

Key Concepts:
Environment: The agent interacts with the LunarLander-v2 environment, where it receives observations (position, velocity, angle, etc.) and chooses actions (fire main/side engines).
Neural Network: A neural network predicts Q-values for each possible action in a given state.
Replay Memory: Experiences are stored and sampled randomly for training, which stabilizes the learning process.
Epsilon-Greedy Policy: The agent explores by taking random actions with a probability ε (epsilon) and exploits by taking the action with the highest Q-value with a probability (1-ε).
Training Loop:
Initialize the environment and the agent.
For each episode:
Reset the environment and get the initial state.
For each time step:
Choose an action based on the epsilon-greedy policy.
Perform the action and observe the next state, reward, and done flag.
Store the transition in the replay buffer.
Sample a batch of transitions from the replay buffer and update the Q-network.
Update the target Q-network periodically.
Repeat until the lunar lander is either safely landed or crashes.
After training, save the trained model for future use.
Usage
1. Training the Agent:
To train the DQN agent, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python lunar_lander_dql.py
The script will train the agent in the LunarLander-v2 environment and periodically output the agent’s performance (episode reward).

2. Watching a Trained Agent:
To see the trained agent in action, load the saved model and visualize the performance:

python
Copy code
python lunar_lander_dql.py --play
3. Key Parameters:
epsilon (ε): Controls the exploration rate. Starts high and decays over time.
gamma (γ): Discount factor for future rewards.
learning_rate: The step size for updating the neural network.
batch_size: The number of experiences sampled from the replay buffer during training.
target_update_frequency: How often the target Q-network is updated.
max_episodes: Number of training episodes.
These parameters can be tweaked within the lunar_lander_dql.py script.

Example Output
During training, the agent will gradually improve its performance. The cumulative reward for each episode will be printed, and you should see the agent learning to land the module safely with fewer crashes over time.

bash
Copy code
Episode: 1/1000 | Reward: -150.00 | Epsilon: 1.0
Episode: 50/1000 | Reward: -80.00 | Epsilon: 0.8
Episode: 200/1000 | Reward: 50.00 | Epsilon: 0.5
Episode: 1000/1000 | Reward: 250.00 | Epsilon: 0.01
Performance Evaluation
The performance of the trained agent is measured by the total reward accumulated during an episode. The ideal reward for a perfect landing is approximately 200+, while a failed landing results in negative rewards. The agent's performance is expected to improve over time as it learns to land smoothly with higher rewards.

Key Challenges
Exploration vs. Exploitation: Balancing the agent’s need to explore the environment to learn more versus exploiting known actions that give high rewards.
Sparse Rewards: The lunar lander environment has sparse rewards, making it challenging to learn, especially in early episodes.
Stability: Neural networks can be unstable when used to approximate Q-values. The project addresses this through experience replay and target networks.
Results
After sufficient training (around 1000-1500 episodes), the DQL agent should be able to land the lunar module successfully most of the time. The model can be further fine-tuned for better performance, but the current setup provides a solid foundation.
